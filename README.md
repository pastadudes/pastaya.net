# pastaya.net

my website  
has been rewritten in rust cuz i don't know javascript and the only guy that knows it is @sobakintech lol  
features:

- automatic markdown compiler (sadly doesn't insert compiled html into /blog/index.html automatically... YET)
- a counter (that has effects when you reach special numbers)
- a website

## cloning
use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pastaya-net/website`  
if yo dumb ahh forgot the flag then do `git submodule init && git submodule update` and problem solved (hopefully)

//! counterrs is a replacement for the old Javascript based counter  
//! It extends on the base of the original counter adding:  
//! 1: An anticheat (technically)  
//! 2: Special effects for certain numbers: (plays vine boom at 69 for example)  
//! 3: Faster and type safe.  
//! Of course it has drawbacks, namely that old browsers (around internet explorer age) can't  
//! run it  
//! It also isn't a complete 1:1 version of the old counter because of how it uses local_storage  
//! instead of cookies
// HEY! special_effects() is a STUB!! PLEASE HELP EXPAND IT!

// my goal is for this to ACTUALLY be a good clicker game

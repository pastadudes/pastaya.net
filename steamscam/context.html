        ok so i actually knew the entire time FROM THE FIRST MESSAGE that it was a scam,<br>
         i decided to play along since i was playing some minecraft and i got really annoyed cuz i was about to beat the game<br>
         first i get over that interaction with LUCI or smth idk forgot the name quickly, basically i had almost NO PLAN WHATSOEVER lmao<br>
         so basically i was exchanging information with Computerbiscuit my best friend so we can both think about what to do,<br>
         <img src="screenshots/screenshot1.png" alt="a screenshot of the scammer saying hes support and me explaining my situation" width="599px" height="401px"><br>
         ok so this is the opening message to the scammer (notice how hes using codeblocks)<br>
         <img src="screenshots/screenshot2.png" alt="the scammer asking me to give him my purchase history" width="608px" height="307px"><br>
         this is the scammer telling me to give him the purchase history, what i did was actually inspect elemeted the button out as my excuse lmao<br>
         it kinda failed he found a button called licenses and product activation which is a more barebones purchase history<br>
         hes telling me if i have a phone number on my stean account (which i did) so i lied and said i didnt<br>
         <img src="screenshots/screenshot3.png" alt="me asking why should i link a phone number when i already have an email and steam guard on my phone"><br>
         he told me to link a phone number so the scammer can provide "status of my ban" so as an excuse i told him just email <br>
         he asked me for my email so i told him check the database tho and then he proceeded to "scan" my steam account and he said you should close steam so it doesnt error out<br>
         so i waited like 1 min and i was eating my spaghetti (surpise surpise) and told him yea im offline try now, he found out that im still online<br>
         so i told him i had a browser window open with steam opened as an excuse and he believed it<br>
         afterwards he said he sent an email to my email for a steam RECOVERY link and told me dont click it (pretty late ngl)<br>
         i used it as a chance to say i clicked it<br>
         <img src="screenshots/screenshot4.png" alt="the scammer telling me to give him the recovery link"><br>
         i told him my right click was broken lmao so he told me to click it and copy the url above
         <img src="screenshots/screenshot5.png" alt="a broken recovery link"><br>
         so i took my recovery link and changed it up so its broken, he insisted on the link even when it was broken so i asked him why<br>
         and he went offline and blocked me on both accounts, this is proof that steam scammers are still on the platform,<br>
         anyways finally this is finished this took me 1 hour to code, anyways <a href="../index.html">go back</a>
